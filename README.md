# WestWay

The goal is to produce a KPI for each of the 14 WestWay dealerships, 
detailing how far they are from reaching the 70% target for total staff 
accreditation in the 4 staff areas (Technician, Master Technician, 
Service Advisor, Sales consultants). Accreditation has a 6months and 12 
month phase. Accreditation has a varity of task with differing difficulty, 
wieghted as such:

- Technical Induction - 6
- TNA - 5
- F2F (no booking) - 4
- F2F (booked) - 2
- VCT (no booking) - 3
- VCT (booking) - 2
- E-learning (product retention) - 2
- E-learning (other) - 1

I have produced bar charts and bubble plots comparing staff progress against staff completion, 
for the 4 criteria and the overall picture (per dealership).

I should next aim to produce a plot where by the 'ALL' results can be compared alongside each of for each dealership, 
for executive decision making.

I have the following:

- the mean completion fraction for staff, per dealership, per critiria.
- the fraction of staff that have completed the material, per criteria, per dealership.
- the fraction of staff that have completed their trainning in a dealership.

Splitting by:
- intial course / annual courses
- course type (TNA, F2F, VCT, EL)




Extension work:

- weight result by time required to complete various parts of accreditation course. 
- 100% accreditation.
