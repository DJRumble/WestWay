# WestWay

The goal is to produce a KPI for each of the 14 WestWay dealerships, 
detailing how far they are from reaching the 70% target for total staff 
accreditation in the 4 staff areas (Technician, Master Technician, 
Service Advisor, Sales consultants). Accreditation has a 6 months and 12 
month phase.

Review of plots went well and these are being forwarded to the business.

Wrapping up this project for the time being. Will handover work for possibly form the 
basis of an excel based format later down the line.

Recieved jan 2016 data and plotted this alongside dec 2016 for comparision. 

There are a number of things to be aware of when viewing this plot. 
Most dealerships staff progress is increasing, which is to be expected ... 
however, this is not the whole story as there are a number of difference between the data to be aware of.

- A number of modules (Micra, Note, etc) that were present in the Dec report have now been removed from the Jan report. 
- Micra parts 2 and 3 are in Jan but not in Dec. As no-body has done these I've removed them to present a more accurate comparison. 
- Some dealerships have taken on new staff between dec and jan. These people have no training and drag the overall completion metric down.
- I have identified at least one fault in the Jan spreadsheet. In Dec, Thomas Ganner (T) had a 70% progress whereas in Jan he has 0% as 
all of his course have been set to 0. This result is primarily explains why stourbridge appears to have a drop in progress

Dealership overview comparison and dealership individual plots now save direct to pdf.

Polished off plots and prepared to recieve Jan data.

07/01/2017

Moved forward with the bar charts, creating a dealership overview of the mean staff progress. 

Also introduced error bars on the bars to visualise the spread in progress throughout a criteria.

06/01/2017

Revising the bar and bubble plots.

05/01/2017

I have produced bar charts and bubble plots comparing staff progress against staff completion, 
for the 4 criteria and the overall picture (per dealership).

I should next aim to produce a plot where by the 'ALL' results can be compared alongside each of for each dealership, 
for executive decision making. 

04/01/2017

I have the following:

- the mean completion fraction for staff, per dealership, per critiria.
- the fraction of staff that have completed the material, per criteria, per dealership.
- the fraction of staff that have completed their trainning in a dealership.

Splitting by:
- intial course / annual courses
- course type (TNA, F2F, VCT, EL)




Accreditation has a varity of task with differing difficulty, 
wieghted as such:

- Technical Induction - 6
- TNA - 5
- F2F (no booking) - 4
- F2F (booked) - 2
- VCT (no booking) - 3
- VCT (booking) - 2
- E-learning (product retention) - 2
- E-learning (other) - 1



Extension work:

- weight result by time required to complete various parts of accreditation course. 
- 100% accreditation.
