# WestWay

The goal is to produce a KPI for each of the 14 WestWay dealerships, 
detailing how far they are from reaching the 70% target for total staff 
accreditation in the 4 staff areas (Technician, Master Technician, 
Service Advisor, Sales consultants). 

Extension work:

- weight result by time required to complete various parts of accreditation course. 
- 100% accreditation.
